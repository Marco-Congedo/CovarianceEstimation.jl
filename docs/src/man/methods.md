# Methods

In the following, an ``n \times p`` matrix ``X`` describing ``n`` observations
with ``p`` variables. Additionally, single observations are denoted by ``x``
and ``y`` with means, respectively, ``\bar x`` and ``\bar y``.

## Simple and corrected covariance

Simple covariance: ``\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x) (y_i-\bar y)^*``.

Corrected covariance: ``\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x) (y_i-\bar y)^*``.
